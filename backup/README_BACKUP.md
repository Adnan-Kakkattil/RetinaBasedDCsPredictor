# Backup Directory

This directory contains utility scripts and documentation files that have been moved from the root directory to keep it clean.

## Files in Backup

- `create_enhanced_dataset.py` - Script to create augmented dataset from existing images
- `create_sample_dataset.py` - Script to generate synthetic sample dataset
- `run.bat` / `run.sh` - Old execution scripts (replaced by production scripts)
- `install_gpu_support.bat` - GPU installation helper script
- `DATASET_DOWNLOAD_GUIDE.md` - Dataset download instructions (info now in main README)
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Quick start guide (info now in main README)
- `TRAINING_SUMMARY.md` - Training summary report

## Usage

These files are still functional. If you need them:

1. Copy them back to root directory if needed
2. Run them from backup directory (adjust paths)
3. Refer to main README.md for updated instructions

## Note

All information from these files has been integrated into the main README.md file for easier access and better organization.
